      Travelling is the act of moving from one place to another, often for leisure, business, or personal reasons. It involves exploring new destinations, experiencing different cultures, and meeting new people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many tourists enjoy immersing themselves in local cultures and trying new food. Stay travelling, stay happy, enjoy your life! Tourism is travel for pleasure, and the commercial activity of providing and supporting such travel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The United Nations defines tourism more broadly, covering people travelling and staying outside their usual environment for leisure, business, or other purposes. Tourism can be domestic or international and plays a significant role in many economies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tourism has environmental and social impacts and is shifting towards sustainability. Organizations are focusing on minimizing negative effects while promoting positive local development.
